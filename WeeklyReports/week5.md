## XFoil Project

I created a LaTeX template for my project and completed the angle of attack, published data, and reynolds number analysis.

My goal is to finish the camber and thickness analysis and coefficient of moment discussions by Thursday and begin Project 2 by next meeting.

Why does the moment curve have two peaks?
