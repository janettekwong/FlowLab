### QUESTIONS TO ANSWER ####
Wing area length vs chord length? 
    Equation breaks down. You would have to come up with a different pi group

Increase velocity? 
    Increase lift
    The underlying thing is dynamic similarity

## 3. Angle of Attack Analysis

# Lift vs Angle
What are the parts of the lift eq?
    A is planar area (shadow area)
    p is density of fluid
    V is velocity of fluid
    1/2*p*A*V^2 is the dynamic pressure
    Cd is the ratio of lift (L) to dynamic pressure

Is it supposed to increase?
    The lift coefficient increases with increasing angle of attack because the pressure on
    the upper edge of the airfoil is lower than the lower edge.

Why the peak?
    The rounding before the peak is due to flow separation starting closer and closer to the
    leading edge of an airfoil as the AOA increases.
    The peak occurs once the flow separates at the leading edge.
    After that, the turbulence behind the wing causes a significant decrease in lift 
    and increase in drag.

Why is lift positive when the angle of attack is negative?
    This is due to the camber. Because of the slight curvature in the airfoil, even at a 
    slight downward angle (like -2 degrees), the overall pressure field is still pushing
    it up. Another way to put it is that airfoils with camber can have an Angle of Zero Lift
    that is negative--meaning that the AOA where the coeffient of lift goes to zero happens
    at a negative angle.

What would happen to the lift at a -AOA with a symmetric airfoil? + or -
    The lift at a negative angle of attack for a symmetric airfoil is negative, it crosses through
    the origin. 

What happens to the lift coefficent at angles of attack higher than the stall angle?
    The lift coefficent dips down right after the stall angle is reached. 
    It seems to jump between 0.6 and 1.0 after that, however, because the drag is 
    high it isn't feasible for planes

    birds - kites
    rockets return to earth

How does it change with different velocities?
    Doubling the velocity would 4x the coefficient of lift beccause of how the Cl equation
    is arranged. They are quadratically related.

How bad until it stalls? even when the lift starts dropping its still higher than other points
    Stall is relatively sudden, but not so sudden that a plane will just drop out of the sky.
    Afterwards it just fluctuates up and down.

What's a good enough lift coefficient to fly? A plane, or a drone
    Generally 1.2-1.5 is the lift coefficient at takeoff. However, with the air foil provided
    the maximum lift coefficent barely reaches that range. I learned that there are high-lift 
    devices that increase the lift during flight to help the airplane take off. Flaps and slats
    will increase the camber, therefore reducing the necessary velocity to take off.


# Drag vs Angle
What causes the dramatic increase in drag at a certain point?
    This is caused by the flow separation behind the airfoil

Is a larger drag when at a negative angle of attack (like landing an airplane) ever a good thing?
    Yes, when descending it helps to slow the plane down faster.

Why is the drag coefficient curve a U shape? Why slightly offset to the right, not centered at zero?
    It seems to start increasing rapidly around -5 and 7 degrees
    Drag is a combination of profile (parasitic) drag from the shape of the airfoil and lift-induced drag
    from the square of the lift coefficient. Lift-induced (pressure) drag causes the dramatic 
    increase in drag at high angles of attack.

Where is the increase of drag the greatest? Is that the stall point?
    Yes


    
# Moment vs Angle
What is coefficient of moment?
    moment caused by relocating the resultant force due to the pressure field to the quarter chord.
    
How do other airfoils change the coefficient of moment?
    symmetric airfoils have zero coefficient of moment - look into it again

So would a specific angle offest the moment?
Is having zero moment good?
    It is neutral, however if a airfoil goes up into stall it won't level itself.

Is there an advantage to having some moment?
    Yes, it will help level out the airfoil
    2 degrees is the minimum moment
    13 degrees is the maximum moment

Where is the center of gravity? How much does that affect the moment/lift?
    Actually a better question is the center of pressure
    The farther away the center of pressure is from the quarter-chord, the larger the moment

## 4. Published Data Analysis
How does it compare to my data?
    check webplot digitizer
    Lift was pretty close
    Moment data was less clear



## 5. Reynolds Number Analysis
# Lift vs Re
How does a low Re impact lift, drag and moment?

Lift: The stall angle rose to ?? instead of around 14 degrees. This must be due to the
fact that it is not as easy for the flow to separate. The slope of the lift coefficient
to AOA rose more slowly because ???


Drag: Drag values for the lower Re were greater, probably due to the increased viscosity
of the fluid the airfoil is going through.

Moment: The curve describing the moment coefficient to AOA still resembles a negative
cubic function. However, it appears that the cubic function is spread over a larger range
of AOA values

Does a low Re decrease lift? Like flying through syrup
    The lift was lower at a lower AOA, it crossed through the origin

At what point does it get too high? Like flying through a vacuum
What does the curve look like? I think there is a table in the fluids textbook


# Drag vs Re
I would expect lower drag with higher Re, is that true?
What is the shape of that curve?

# Moment vs Re


## 6. Camber and Thickness Analysis
# Camber to drag ratio and lift curve slope behavior
Does more camber (curvature) wing change increase lift and drag?

At what point does more camber start causing a decrease in performance (lower lift/higher drag)?

Does camber influence where the center of the drag U is? Is the symmetric one centered around zero?



# Thickness to drag ratio and lift curve slope behavior
Does a thicker wing have less lift and more drag?


## 7. Other Questions
What about the cross-sectional area of the wing? A is planar area but a long, skinny wing is different from a short thick one.
