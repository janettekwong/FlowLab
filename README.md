# XFOIL Branch – Winter 2025 Research Project #1

This branch contains my work for Winter 2025 Research Project #1:  
**Learning XFOIL with Julia**

## Summary

- **Goal:** Become familiar with XFOIL, a tool for airfoil analysis.
- **Language:** Julia (for scripting and automating XFOIL tasks)
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Installed and ran XFOIL locally
  - Automated XFOIL runs and parameter sweeps using Julia scripts
  - Parsed and visualized XFOIL output data in Julia
  - Explored basic principles of airfoil simulation and aerodynamic analysis

## Highlights

- Developed simple Julia scripts to call XFOIL and process results
- Learned how to interpret XFOIL output and troubleshoot common issues
- Gained a better understanding of airfoil performance metrics

## Structure

- `src/` – Julia scripts for XFOIL automation
- `data/` – Example input/output files
- `notebooks/` – Analysis and visualization
